# Superchaos

Superchaos can be invoked via two main mix tasks:

**mix chaos.generate** - Generates the seed sample data to work with (providers, members, and consults) by generating the event stream

**mix chaos.simulate** - Begins simulating realtime queue manipulation via multiple Elixir async tasks
